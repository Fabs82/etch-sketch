A browser version of something between a Sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Create a grid of divs that will change color when hovering on them with the mouse

STEP 1
1. Create a div in HTML as main container (square?) for the divs (16x16)
2. Style the main container with CSS to make it visible
3. Create a function in JS that create the selected number of divs and append them to the main container (loop?).
4. Style the divs to make them visible (borders, etc.)
5. Use Flexbox so that the divs appear on multiple lines (wrap?) and not on only one

STEP 2
Hovering

STEP 3
MAke the sketchpad interactive. Prompt a message asking the user to set how many squares he wants
